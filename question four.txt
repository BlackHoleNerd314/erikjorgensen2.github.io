
Question Four: Why do we need a Unified Field Theory? What is real? How does it work? The theory of everything is the answer to all of these questions, questions that humankind have asked for many thousands of years. It has to do with curiosity, our drive to figure things out. Without curiosity, our modern day civilization would come to its immediate end. However, for most of human history, religious belief has dominated our culture. It wasn’t until very recently that rational scientific thinking, started to question everything that was once known to be true. The pioneers of the scientific revolution, were inevitably tortured and killed for their heretical beliefs. The theory of everything is the end goal of science, a set of equations from which the entire cosmos can be computed. When most people hear of the theory of everything, it is usually dismissed as some kind of science fiction story that doesn’t actually exist in the real world. Those who are educated might remember that boring physics class in high school. Others are completely baffled by the series of newspaper articles about quantum mechanics they find online. And yes, there are those who outright reject such a premise, because it contradicts their faith. However in science, it is not about what you want to be true, or feel like should be true. It is about what is actually true. And as it goes, the truth is stranger than any fiction. Surprisingly, we already have the theory of everything! The scientists gave it the boring and somewhat misleading name, the standard model. It was finally completed back in 2013, by the discovery of the so called “God” particle or Higgs boson. The standard model of physics is the single greatest achievement of all time. Every experiment ever done has done nothing but confirm this theory. The theory of everything should be celebrated as a turning point in human history. The real question is why? There are many kinds of ways that most people approach quantum mechanics. Some object by saying, “Just shut up and calculate!”. This has worked well in the experimental verification of the theory, useful in particle colliders. But the mathematical analysis and other calculational tools can only take us so far. A deeper understanding is needed to really know what is going on. I will reply by pointing out, “What part of modern physics do you not understand?”. For the layperson, it is very easy to get utterly confused. Some misinterpret it to mean something completely different than it actually is. And then there is the over-abundance of particles in the news. Worse yet, some lunatics even claim to have the idea that consciousness can control the quantum realm. In the rest of this book, I hope to clear up the confusion. For the engineers and other practically minded people out there, the theory of everything supersedes their common sense view of the world, and not the other way around! Newton’s laws are only an approximation to the real thing. They will say that for all intents and purposes, the approximation is good enough, because it will agree to the number of significant digits they need. However in science, a theory is rejected when it contradicts new data. And since newtonian mechanics differs from the real deal, it is wrong. However, there is a sense in which Newton is right after all. As I will soon explain in more detail, we still study the fundamentals, because in their domain of validity newton’s laws of motion do indeed give the correct answers. It is just that outside that domain of validity, we cannot trust our senses. About common sense. All major religions in the world have one thing in common. Many who have faith suffer from a scientific illness. It is often said that the Bible or Quran or whatever, is the “true word of God”, and should never be questioned. This sort of idea shuts off the rational curiosity within all of us and replaces it with the fear of hell. It is a great thing to believe and have faith, but when we impose our ideas on other people who might not have the same beliefs as us, this is a bad, really bad idea! Common sense does have its biological purpose in our everyday lives. And yes, the theory of everything is in fact, “just a theory”. However, when most believers approach the scientists, they mean something completely new and radical. They mean to say , “What proof do you have that the theory of everything of the current era, be it Democritus, Newton, or even Einstein, wouldn’t just be superseded by a completely new theory that is better and more accurate?”! As it turns out, this is a serious blow to the engineer’s approximations. The theory of everything as it stands avoids such problems, because the theory has been confirmed beyond the validity of the domain of our everyday lives. Any new physics that is discovered and added in to the standard theory won’t change the main predictions of the theory too significantly. So although the theory of everything is not the final story of science, the theory of everything is an approximation that works for our own universe, just like how the physics you learned in high school is yet another approximation. So the theory of everything is then the only theory that simultaneously, is a scientific theory, yet also is completely confirmed by experiment. And this, we have in our possession. Enough delaying. What is the theory of everything exactly? The theory of everything uses math and equations in order to describe the fact that empty space has properties. We call such “properties of space”, a field. Then it follows that the equations that the field obeys, is known as a field theory. Moreover, the field itself doesn’t just have any properties, but wave like properties. So that is the theory of everything in a nutshell, a “quantum” field theory. Studying QFT is hard. In fact it is so hard that even modern supercomputers find it difficult. This is because of the math that is used to define it. Mathematics! Why does math work so well in describing natural phenomena? I mean, come on! Look around you, everything is math. It might just be that the theory of everything does its best describing nature as a mathematical formula, because math is all there is to reality! Think of it. It is a lot more accurate to say that this building is 100 feet tall, instead of saying that the building over there is huge. Huge is a relative term. So even though mathematics gives the exact answer, it won’t be of much use unless we can actually visualize it in our minds, as if we were actually there. However, the theory of everything is only defined mathematically, so it will take some time for me to introduce it conceptually. Hi, I am Erik Daniel Jorgensen, and the hard truth is that a society without a theory of everything will not stand the test of time. I want the human race to continue on forever, no matter the sacrifice. This is why I devoted my entire life to figuring it all out. Everyone has their haters, why let them derail your progress? My question is: What is the theory of everything? And when I figure it out, how will other people hurt me with for discovering it? I have autism, which means that I see the world differently. This fact is both a blessing and a curse. I have incredible spacial awareness and can understand physics equations with a laser like focus. To me, it feels as if I am having a controlled out of body experience, where my curiosity and imagination guides my flight through deep space and deep time. However, my intelligence does come with a dark side. My family, friends, and support staff, are all here to help me with these challenges. They know me as the nerdy one. I care deeply about my hobby of figuring out everything, and sometimes this leads me into deep trouble. I have lost so much time on my computer by myself, that I have not had the time to take care of myself. Some people have also attacked me for my beliefs, because they see me as a serious threat. Most if not all of these haters, have little to no understanding in science, which is a sad thing. But as I say: progress not perfection. Most people that have known me have not taken me seriously. One reason why this is, is due to their inability to do what I do. And what is worse than to be completely average. I am lucky to be the one to stand out. With this gift, I am certainly fit to know the theory of everything. I am determined to know the universe the way it was supposed to be seen: By someone like myself who has the courage to see beyond theoretical and personal obstacles. But, one question remains to be asked: How to overcome the need for a creator in one’s worldview? Me and my dad would argue over this for weeks at a time. My dad is a devout christian, and would argue that Bible equals truth. I passionately disagree, because I know how much more indifferent the vast scales of the universe are to us humans. If God did exist, he would certainly mention all of his creation in a unified manner: A theory of everything. I definitely don’t see any Biblical texts to be of scientific merit as they are chot full of contradictions. The bible is clearly not a science textbook and thus definitely not the true word of God. My dad then puts the argument on me to explain why even though its not a science textbook, why the Bible can still be the word of God. This is where things get weird. My dad cannot just accept that my worldview is scientific and his is religious. If I can agree to disagree that he believes in the Bible. He must do the same to me. I have no more evidence than he does on the existence of a creator. However I since I have the ability to figure out through online physics research and computer simulation what works and doesn’t work, I have my own ideas about what God is and how his consciousness reaches inside all of us. The creator is the sum total of all of the laws of physics, along with a mechanism to simulate or reproduce reality. Science is only a tool, and we need to be very careful how we use it. What we need are new ways of doing science that nobody has ever done before. The descriptions of physics we have now will be obsolete in building a unified field theory of everything. This book is not a warning. It is not a sermon. It is not a rejection of all that came before. It is an invitation. To think. To question. To imagine what a better universe looks like — not just philosophically, but scientifically. For too long, humanity has clung to myths to explain what it did not understand. We passed down sacred stories built not on data, but on fear. Not on structure, but on authority. And when someone challenged those stories — not out of rebellion, but out of curiosity — society often turned away. In 2013, the scientific world stood at a crossroads. The discovery of the Higgs boson should have sparked a re-evaluation of what truly mattered — what could be built on real, testable structure. But instead, much of academia turned toward strings, abstraction, and mathematical aesthetics. Beautiful ideas, yes. But detached. Untestable. Frozen in theory. My work, my life’s theory — the one you now hold in your hands — was not born in a university. It was born in pain. In exile. In places that tried to erase the very curiosity that fuels discovery. But I didn’t stop. Because I believe the next generation deserves better. They deserve a new kind of scripture — not one of commandments and condemnations, but one of collapsing fields and expanding minds. They deserve a book that teaches not what to believe, but how to question, how to simulate, how to reason from the ground up. This theory of everything is not myth. It is structure. It is not ideology. It is geometry. It is not dogma. It is data, shaped by collapse, bounded by spacetime, and made accessible through natural units, logic, and low-level simulations. I do not write this to be worshiped. I write this to be built upon. To the students who will come after me, who will read this not just as a manifesto but as a textbook, a simulation manual, a guide to modeling reality from first principles — this book is for you. Let it be your launchpad. Let it be your framework. Let it be your permission to build, to expand, to question, to challenge the rigid beliefs of both religion and rigid orthodoxy. You don’t have to inherit a broken story. You can write your own. And maybe, just maybe, this book — born from collapse, carried through chaos, and shaped by the love and loss of everything I’ve lived — can be your first step toward the universe you were always meant to explore. After so many fits and false starts, I know what the theory of everything is and how it works. I do this for my family. I do this for everyone else too. I hope everyone will see that I am speaking the truth here. People come up with theories of everything on a daily basis. I thus wonder how much my life story will make a difference in both my hobbies and my family. On with the book…
